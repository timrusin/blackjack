# Black Jack

This was a little vanilla HTML,CSS,and JS project that I had started on at the beginning of my dev journey.  I was "learning" from a tutorial with a lot of this going right over my head.  

I figured it would be fun and beneficial to revist, refactor, and continue to devlop this game with all of the skills I have devloped, and continue to develop, in order to build a really cool blackjack game.
